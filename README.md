# Supply_Chain_Data_Analytics

Supply Chain Data Analytics Capstone

This project, completed as the final requirement for my Master of Science in Data Analytics at the University of Maryland Global Campus, applies advanced data analytics and machine learning to address inefficiencies in supply chain inventory management and demand forecasting.

Using multiple large-scale datasets (>20,000 records, >20 variables each), the project integrates predictive modeling, data visualization, and feature engineering to improve operational decision-making. The analysis focuses on minimizing inventory imbalances, reducing delivery delays, and enhancing supplier performance through measurable KPIs:
	•	Precision ≥ 90%
	•	Recall ≥ 85%
	•	F1-Score ≥ 87%
	•	AUC-ROC ≥ 90%

Key Features
	•	Data Preparation & Cleansing: Handling missing values, outliers, skewness, and imbalanced target variables.
	•	Feature Engineering: Creating new attributes to capture supply chain performance drivers.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying patterns, correlations, and trends in logistics data.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Building and comparing multiple models (e.g., SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM) to select a champion model.
	•	Visualization: Clear, actionable dashboards and charts to communicate insights.

Tools & Technologies
	•	Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	CRISP-DM Framework

Outcomes

The final report and presentation deliver:
	•	Actionable insights for inventory and logistics optimization.
	•	A tested predictive model with high recall for late delivery classification.
	•	Recommendations for future analytics to strengthen supply chain resilience.
